Can I live in this new world?
Feels like these nerves are shot
There's something I forgot
Have I walked into a trap?
No words are coming through
What happens now?

On the edge, on the wing
Turn your head, tuning in
Coming back, coming down
Don't give in too soon

The only way out leads right through
The past that was destroyed
The path that I avoid
A blade of moonlight in the cave
Don't show that you're afraid
What happens now?

On the edge, on the wing
Turn your head, tuning in
Coming back, coming down
Don't give in too soon
Coming back, coming down
Don't give in too soon

On the edge, on the wing
Turn your head, tuning in
Coming back, coming down
Don't give in too soon

Hold your line, hold your nerve
Don't give in too soon
